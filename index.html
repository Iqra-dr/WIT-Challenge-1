            <p>Here you can learn about the various deserts you can make with baking as the main cooking technique, for
                example:</p>
            <li>Cakes</li>

            <li>Pastries and rolls</li>
            <li>Muffins</li>
            <p>Before you embark on your baking journey, it is important to learn a couple of basic measurements <br>
                <code>
                1 tbsp = 15 gms<br>
                1 tbsp = 3 tsp<br>
                1 tbsp = 14.7mls<br>
                </code></p>
            <p>Additionally, you should also be aware of temperature conversions, for example:<br>
                <code>(0°C × 9/5) + 32 = 32°F

                    </code></p>

            <p>If you're all hoity toity about health, I guess this is your closest deal to having a tasty treat. Be
                sure to not pick the bran ones!</p>
            <p>Muffins have a denser body than cupcakes but if baked right, can be just as sensational in taste. They
                are less calorically dense too, owing to the fact that they require much less sugar:<br>
                <code>Your "average" muffin from, say, a leading chain of café-bakeries, is 5.5 ounces and has 511 calories; its average cupcake is 3 ounces and 356 calories</code><br>
