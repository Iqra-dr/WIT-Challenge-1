            <p>This webpage will teach you the basics of baked goods</p>
            <p>Here you can learn about the various deserts you can make with baking as the main cooking technique, for
                example:</p>
            <li>Cakes</li>
            <li>Tarts</li>
            <li>Pastries and rolls</li>
            <li>Muffins</li>
            <p>Before you embark on your baking journey, it is important to learn a couple of basic measurements <br>
                <code>
                1 tbsp = 15 gms<br>
                1 tbsp = 3 tsp<br>
                1 tbsp = 14.7mls<br>
                </code></p>
            <p>Additionally, you should also be aware of temperature conversions, for example:<br>
                <code>(0°C × 9/5) + 32 = 32°F

                    </code></p>

            <p>Tasty spongy delights to commemorate any occasion</p>
            <p>Cake is often served as a celebratory dish on ceremonial occasions, such as weddings, anniversaries, and
                birthdays. There are countless cake recipes; some are bread-like, some are rich and elaborate, and many
                are centuries old. Cake making is no longer a complicated procedure; while at one time considerable
                labor went into cake making (particularly the whisking of egg foams), baking equipment and directions
                have been simplified so that even the most amateur of cooks may bake a cakeOur family recipes and secret
                ingredients will help you master the skill of baking any type of cake you'd
                like</p>
            <p>Sometimes, the same batter for cakes can be divided to make cupcakes, for example:<br>
                <code>One 9” x 13” cake = 24 standard cupcakes</code></p>

            <p>As the name suggests, super tangy, super tartful, delicious tiny treats</p>
            <p>Tarts are typically free-standing with firm pastry base consisting of dough, itself made of flour, thick
                filling, and perpendicular sides while pies may have softer pastry, looser filling, and sloped sides,
                necessitating service from the pie plateTarts can be customised and serve as both sweet or savory
                concoctions! They can be very healthy owing to
                the numerous fruits that gel well with them. Such as:</p>
            <li>Berries</li>
            <li>Apples</li>
            <li>Canteloupes</li><br>

            <header>Pastries and rolls</header>
            <p>Soft and gooey, but could be spongy too. Mouth watering delicious treats. Pastry is differentiated from
                bread by having a higher fat content, which contributes to a flaky or crumbly texture. A good pastry is
                light and airy and fatty, but firm enough to support the weight of the filling. When making a shortcrust
                pastry, care must be taken to blend the fat and flour thoroughly before adding any liquid. This ensures
                that the flour granules are adequately coated with fat and less likely to develop gluten. On the other
                hand, overmixing results in long gluten strands that toughen the pastry. In other types of pastry such
                as Danish pastry and croissants, the characteristic flaky texture is achieved by repeatedly rolling out
                a dough similar to that for yeast bread, spreading it with butter, and folding it to produce many thin
                layers. </p>

            <p>If you're all hoity toity about health, I guess this is your closest deal to having a tasty treat. Be
                sure to not pick the bran ones!:) </p>
            <p>Muffins have a denser body than cupcakes but if baked right, can be just as sensational in taste. They
                are less calorically dense too, owing to the fact that they require much less sugar:<br>
                <code>Your "average" muffin from, say, a leading chain of café-bakeries, is 5.5 ounces and has 511 calories; its average cupcake is 3 ounces and 356 calories</code><br>
